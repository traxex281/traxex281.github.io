  <h1>Selenium Automated Testing</h1>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Selenium, Java, TestNG, Maven</p>
  <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Automated Regression & UI Testing</p>

  <p>Automated login flows, UI checks, and regression tests to catch issues early and reduce repetitive manual testing effort.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reduced 15+ hours of regression work per release</li>
    <li>Early detection of bugs before production releases</li>
    <li>Tests break if a new feature is introduced unannounced—acts as an alert system</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I inherited the framework and focused on building test cases for new features and monthly maintenance. Integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate the whole testing process.</p>
