      <p style="margin: 30px;"> &#9792; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;April 28, 1996 <br> &#9742; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;09996764713<br>&#127960;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baclayan, Boljoon, Cebu<br>&#128386;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; traxex281@gmail.com<br>&#128386;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; www.linkedin.com/in/hermaine-catherine-canania-6b2549143</p>
      <p style="margin: 30px;">
        Hello! I’m a 29-year-old <strong>Senior Software Engineer with over 5 years of professional experience</strong>, specializing in <strong>test automation, RPA, and software quality assurance</strong>.
        Over the years, I’ve developed a strong technical foundation and a passion for building reliable systems that enhance efficiency and performance.
        My technical toolkit includes <strong>Selenium for web automation, Automation Anywhere bots to automate repetitive, rule-based digital tasks, and Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipeline integration, comprehensive test cases and plans and logging of defects</strong>.
        I’m proficient in programming with <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and I enjoy designing scripts and frameworks that solve real-world challenges.
      </p>    
      <p style="margin: 30px;">
        One of my key experiences has been working with <strong>ServiceNow applications</strong>, where I performed functional and end-to-end testing, created reusable test cases, and collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless performance across modules.
        I’ve also handled ServiceNow data monitoring and integration testing including automations that compare UI and backend data using sys_ids, helping to identify inconsistencies and speed up resolution processes.
      </p>    
      <p style="margin: 30px;">
        I'm someone who enjoys solving complex problems, refining software processes, and ensuring that every product I work on meets high-quality standards.
        I take pride in being analytical, detail-oriented, and adaptable in fast-paced environments, and I’m always eager to learn new tools and methods that improve workflow and testing accuracy.
      </p>    
      <p style="margin: 30px;">
        Beyond work, I have a vibrant mix of hobbies that keep me creative, relaxed, and balanced.
        I’m a huge fan of K-pop, K-dramas, Disney movies, Barbie films, and Hollywood blockbusters.
        Whether I’m binge-watching an emotional K-drama or reliving the magic of Disney classics, these interests help me recharge and stay inspired.
        I also love playing video games. They’re not only entertaining but also stimulate my critical thinking and focus.
      </p>    
      <p style="margin: 30px;">
        I’m also an animal lover through and through. I currently live with 20 dogs and 4 cats, and each of them brings joy and chaos into my life in the best way possible.
        Taking care of them has taught me patience, responsibility, and the importance of emotional connection.
        They keep my heart full and my life grounded, especially after long hours of coding and debugging.
      </p>   
      <p style="margin: 30px;">
        I believe in working hard while staying true to the things that bring joy and meaning.
        My love for technology, pop culture, and animals fuels both my personal growth and professional journey.
        Whether I’m automating workflows, tackling bugs, bonding with my pets, or dancing to my favorite K-pop playlist, I bring dedication, enthusiasm, and a touch of fun to everything I do.

      <h4>Work Experience</h4>
      <div class="experience-info">
          <p><b>Test Automation Senior Analyst</b> | Accenture Inc.<br>2020- Present</p>
          <p>&bullet; Developed Automation Anywhere bot to automate data integration monitoring, reducing manual effort by
            95%. The bot extracts data from ServiceNow UI and database, compares them using SQL queries, and
            generates an Excel report listing missing records. Implemented web automation, database automation, and
            email integration, reducing data inconsistencies by 95%.
            <br>&bullet; Developed an automated UI testing framework for ServiceNow applications, achieving 100% test coverage
            and eliminating the need for manual testing. Utilized Selenium with Java, TestNG, and Azure DevOps for
            seamless CI/CD integration. Leveraged JavaScript to handle dynamic and complex Shadow DOM elements,
            improving test reliability and accuracy.
            <br>&bullet; Enhanced and maintained the automation framework for ServiceNow applications, achieving 100% test coverage
            and eliminating the need for manual testing. Utilized Selenium with Java, TestNG, and Azure DevOps for
            seamless CI/CD integration. Leveraged JavaScript to handle dynamic and complex Shadow DOM elements,
            improving test reliability and accuracy.
            <br>&bullet; Performed end-to-end manual testing of ServiceNow applications to ensure all functions met business and
            performance requirements. Created test plans and cases for regression, smoke, and functional testing, contributing to improved system stability and reduced defects.
            <br>&bullet; Provided primary support for Always On/Nearly Always On ServiceNow applications, regularly monitoring and analyzing tickets submitted by consumers to verify if they fall within the scope of the application. Played a critical role during minor and major deployments by performing production verification to ensure system
            stability and data integrity post-release.
            <br>&bullet; Conducted data validation between ServiceNow and database using SQL. Designed and executed efficient
            queries using LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to compare two or more tables and identify mismatched or missing
            records. This approach helped minimize manual review and ensured data consistency across systems.
            <br>&bullet; Collaborated closely with developers and business analysts to troubleshoot and resolve critical defects.
            Maintained open communication across teams to ensure timely fixes and high-quality releases.
            <br>&bullet; Managed deployments and supported production go-lives by checking UI behavior, backend processes, and
            the sync between ServiceNow and the database.
            <br>&bullet; Point of Contact (POC) for quarterly production data deletion activities for ServiceNow applications and
            backend databases. Responsible for verifying successful deletion of selected records and ensuring
            associated table data is properly removed without affecting unrelated records.
            <br>&bullet; Integrated API testing into the regression suite alongside Selenium with Java, ensuring full coverage from API
            to UI. Verified that data flows correctly by checking database entries and that payloads were successfully
            sent to EY systems. This improved end-to-end testing efficiency and ensured accurate data communication
            between systems. </p>
